## Features

- Browse and select photos from your camera to download
- Supports both WiFi and USB connections
- Preview photos in terminal
- Cross-platform (macOS, Linux, Windows, Termux, etc.)
- Won't download photos that already exist in the download directory

## Installation

Install with Go:

```bash
go install github.com/tonytwostep/grsync-tui@latest
```

Or build manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tonytwostep/grsync-tui.git
cd grsync-tui
go build -o grsync-tui
./grsync-tui
```

## Configuration

On first run, a config file is automatically created at `~/.config/grsync-tui.json` with some safe defaults.

You can edit this file to set:

- `connection_method`: `"usb"` or `"wifi"`
- `download_dir`: Directory where downloaded photos are saved
- `usb.camera_dir`: Path to the mounted camera directory (for USB mode)

## Usage

Run `grsync-tui` in your terminal.
